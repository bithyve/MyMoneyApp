##### Permissions
To use the camera on Android you must ask for camera permission:
```java
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
To enable `video recording` feature you have to add the following code to the `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```java
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

## Migrating from RCTCamera to RNCamera

See this [doc](./docs/migration.md)

### RNCamera Docs
[RNCamera](./docs/RNCamera.md)

### Docs old RCTCamera
[RCTCamera](./docs/RCTCamera.md)

## Getting started

### Requirements
1. JDK >= 1.7 (if you run on 1.6 you will get an error on "_cameras = new HashMap<>();")
2. With iOS 10 and higher you need to add the "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" key to the Info.plist of your project. This should be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'. Add the following code:
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>

<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>

<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the microphone for video recording -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the microphone is accessed for the first time</string>
```
3. On Android, you require `buildToolsVersion` of `25.0.2+`. _This should easily and automatically be downloaded by Android Studio's SDK Manager._

4. On iOS 11 and later you need to add `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key to the Info.plist. This key lets you describe the reason your app seeks write-only access to the user’s photo library. Info.plist can be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'. Add the following code:
```
<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>
```

### Mostly automatic install with react-native
1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. `react-native link react-native-camera`
*To install it with Windows, see manual install below*

### Mostly automatic install with CocoaPods
1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Add the plugin dependency to your Podfile, pointing at the path where NPM installed it:
```obj-c
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'
```
3. Run `pod install`

*Note:* You might need to adjust your Podfile following the example below:

```ruby
target 'yourTargetName' do
  # See http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies
  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
    'Core',
    'CxxBridge', # Include this for RN >= 0.47
    'DevSupport', # Include this to enable In-App Devmenu if RN >= 0.43
    'RCTText',
    'RCTNetwork',
    'RCTWebSocket', # Needed for debugging
    'RCTAnimation', # Needed for FlatList and animations running on native UI thread
    # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project
  ]

  # Explicitly include Yoga if you are using RN >= 0.42.0
  pod 'yoga', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga'

  # Third party deps podspec link
  pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'

end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    if target.name == "React"
      target.remove_from_project
    end
  end
end
```

### Manual install
#### iOS
1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-camera` and add `RNCamera.xcodeproj`
4. Expand the `RNCamera.xcodeproj` ➜ `Products` folder
5. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNCamera.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
6. Click `RNCamera.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). In the `Search Paths` section, look for `Header Search Paths` and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../../React` - mark both as `recursive`.

### Face Detection or Text Recognition Steps

Face Detection/Text Recognition are optional on iOS. If you want them, you are going to need to install Google Mobile Vision frameworks in your project, as mentioned in the next section.

##### No Face Detection steps

If you do not need it and do not want to install the GMV frameworks, open your app xcode project, on the Project Navigator, expand the RNCamera project, right click on the FaceDetector folder and delete it (move to trash, if you want). If you keep that folder and do not follow the GMV installation steps, your project will not compile.

If you want to make this automatic, you can add a postinstall script to your app `package.json`. Inside the `postinstall_project` there is a xcode project ready with the folder removed (we opened xcode, removed the folder from the project and copied the resulting project file). The post install script is:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Creating project without FaceDetector"
if [ -e node_modules/react-native-camera/ios/FaceDetector ] ; then
  rm -rf node_modules/react-native-camera/ios/FaceDetector
fi
cp node_modules/react-native-camera/postinstall_project/projectWithoutFaceDetection.pbxproj node_modules/react-native-camera/ios/RNCamera.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
```

And add something like this to the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

*Note:* The face detection/text recognition code is excluded by default for the **CocoaPods** installation.
```
"postinstall": "./scripts/post.sh",
```

##### Installing GMV frameworks
GMV (Google Mobile Vision) is used for Face detection/Text recognition by the iOS RNCamera. You have to link the google frameworks to your project to successfully compile the RNCamera project.

###### CocoaPods Path (The only option for Text Recognition)

Modify the dependency towards `react-native-camera` in your
 `Podfile`, from

 ```
 pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'
```

to (for Face Detection)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'FaceDetector'
]
```

or to (for Text Recognition)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'TextDetector'
]
```
*Note:* Text recognition is available only via CocoaPods Path. If you have issues with duplicate symbols you will need to enable dead code stripping option in your Xcode (Target > Build Settings > search for "Dead code stripping") see: https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/issues/487#issuecomment-415313053.

###### Non-CocoaPods Path
1. Download:
Google Symbol Utilities: https://www.gstatic.com/cpdc/dbffca986f6337f8-GoogleSymbolUtilities-1.1.1.tar.gz

    Google Utilities: https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/978f81964b50a7c0/GoogleUtilities-1.3.2.tar.gz

    Google Mobile Vision: https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/df83c97cbca53eaf/GoogleMobileVision-1.1.0.tar.gz

    Google network Utilities: https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/54fd7b7ef8fd3edc/GoogleNetworkingUtilities-1.2.2.tar.gz

    Google Interchange Utilities: https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/1a7f7ba905b2c029/GoogleInterchangeUtilities-1.2.2.tar.gz

2. Extract everything to one folder. Delete "BarcodeDetector" and "copy" folders from Google Mobile Vision.

3. Open XCode, right click on your project and choose "New Group". Rename the new folder to "Frameworks". Right click on "Frameworks" and select "add files to 'YOUR_PROJECT'". Select all content from the folder of step 2, click on Options. Select "Copy items if needed", leave "Create groups" selected and choose all your targets on the "Add to targets" section. Then, click on "Add".

4. On your target -> Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libraries -> add AddressBook.framework
5. On your target -> Build Settings -> Other Linker Flags -> add -lz, -ObjC and -lc++
6. To force indexing and prevent errors, restart xcode and reopen your project again before compiling.

#### Android
1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import org.reactnative.camera.RNCameraPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new RNCameraPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method. Add a comma to the previous item if there's already something there.

3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

	```gradle
	include ':react-native-camera'
	project(':react-native-camera').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-camera/android')
	```

4. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:

	```gradle
    compile (project(':react-native-camera')) {
        exclude group: "com.google.android.gms"
        compile 'com.android.support:exifinterface:25.+'
        compile ('com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:12.0.1') {
            force = true
        }
    }
	```

  > You may need to use different exifinterface versions, e.g. `27.+` instead of `25.+`.

5. Declare the permissions in your Android Manifest (required for `video recording` feature)

  ```java
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  ```

6. Add jitpack to android/build.gradle
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
    }
}
```

The current Android library defaults to the below values for the Google SDK and Libraries,

```gradle
def DEFAULT_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION             = 26
def DEFAULT_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION             = "26.0.2"
def DEFAULT_TARGET_SDK_VERSION              = 26
def DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION    = "12.0.1"
def DEFAULT_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION         = "27.1.0"
```

You can override this settings by adding a Project-wide gradle configuration properties for
use by all modules in your ReactNative project by adding the below to `android/build.gradle`
file,

```gradle
buildscript {...}

allprojects {...}

/**
* Project-wide gradle configuration properties for use by all modules
*/
ext {
    compileSdkVersion           = 26
    targetSdkVersion            = 26
    buildToolsVersion           = "26.0.2"
    googlePlayServicesVersion   = "12.0.1"
    supportLibVersion           = "27.1.0"
}
```

The above settings in the ReactNative project over-rides the values present in the `react-native-camera`
module. For your reference below is the `android/build.gradle` file of the module.

```gradle
buildscript {
...

def DEFAULT_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION             = 26
def DEFAULT_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION             = "26.0.2"
def DEFAULT_TARGET_SDK_VERSION              = 26
def DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION    = "12.0.1"
def DEFAULT_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION         = "27.1.0"

android {
  compileSdkVersion rootProject.hasProperty('compileSdkVersion') ? rootProject.compileSdkVersion : DEFAULT_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION
  buildToolsVersion rootProject.hasProperty('buildToolsVersion') ? rootProject.buildToolsVersion : DEFAULT_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION

  defaultConfig {
    minSdkVersion 16
    targetSdkVersion rootProject.hasProperty('targetSdkVersion') ? rootProject.targetSdkVersion : DEFAULT_TARGET_SDK_VERSION

    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0.0"
  }
  lintOptions {
    abortOnError false
    warning 'InvalidPackage'
  }
}

...

dependencies {
  def googlePlayServicesVersion = rootProject.hasProperty('googlePlayServicesVersion')  ? rootProject.googlePlayServicesVersion : DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION
  def supportLibVersion = rootProject.hasProperty('supportLibVersion')  ? rootProject.supportLibVersion : DEFAULT_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION

  compile 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+'
  compile "com.google.zxing:core:3.2.1"
  compile "com.drewnoakes:metadata-extractor:2.9.1"
  compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:$googlePlayServicesVersion'
  compile 'com.android.support:exifinterface:$supportLibVersion'

  compile 'com.github.react-native-community:cameraview:cc47bb28ed2fc54a8c56a4ce9ce53edd1f0af3a5'
}
```

#### Windows
1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Link the library as described here: [react-native-windows / LinkingLibrariesWindows.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/docs/LinkingLibrariesWindows.md)
For the last step of this guide, you have to add the following things to your `MainReactNativeHost.cs`:
- in the import section at the very top: `using RNCamera;`
- in `protected override List<IReactPackage> Packages => new List<IReactPackage>` add a new line with `new RNCameraPackage()`
3. Add the capabilities (permissions) for the webcam and microphone as described here: [docs.microsoft / audio-video-camera](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/simple-camera-preview-access#add-capability-declarations-to-the-app-manifest)
4. Use `RCTCamera` (RNCamera is not supported yet) like described above

Follow the [Q & A](./docs/QA.md) section if you are having compilation issues.

## Usage

### RNCamera

Take a look into this [documentation](./docs/RNCamera.md).

### RCTCamera

Since `1.0.0`, RCTCamera is deprecated, but if you want to use it, you can see its [documentation](./docs/RCTCamera.md).
