## Reporting Bugs & Feature Requests

If you have found an issue, create an issue on the repo- but make sure to:
* Describe what does happen
* Describe what should happen instead
*i.e. In what way the functionality is different from desired.*

If you would like to request a feature, then by all means and we will try to implement it if reasonable.

If you would like to submit a feature request or report a bug, we encourage you to first look through the [issues](https://github.com/nating/react-native-custom-qr-codes/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/nating/react-native-custom-qr-codes/pulls) before filing a new issue.
