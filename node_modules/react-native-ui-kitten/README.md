# react-native-ui-kitten

react-native-ui-kitten is a framework that contains a set of commonly used UI components styled in a similar way. 
The main idea of this framework is to move style definitions into a specific place making components reusable and styled in a single way.
You just focus on business logic and it takes care of visual appearance. 

We have also brought a concept similar to CSS classes that will save you time when styling elements. 
And the most awesome thing: you can change themes on the fly by just passing a different set of variables. 

100% native. Give our kitten a try!
