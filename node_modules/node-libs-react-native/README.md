# node-libs-react-native

This package provides React Native compatible implementations of Node core modules like `stream` and `http`. This is a fork of [node-libs-browser][] with a few packages swapped to be compatible in React Native.

[node-libs-browser]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-libs-browser

## Installation

```
npm install --save node-libs-react-native
```

## Usage

This package exports a mapping of absolute paths to each module implementation, keyed by module name. Modules without React Native compatible implementations are `null`.

These modules can be used with React Native Packager's `rn-cli.config.js` or Webpack's `resolve.alias`.

### Usage with React Native Packager

Add a `rn-cli.config.js` file in the root directory of your React Native project and set `extraNodeModules`:

```js
// rn-cli.config.js
module.exports = {
  extraNodeModules: require('node-libs-react-native'),
};
```

For more information, see this post on [Node core modules in React Native][post].

### Globals

Node has certain globals that modules may expect, such as `Buffer` or `process`. React Native does not provide these globals. The [`node-libs-react-native/globals`][globals] module in this package will shim the global environment to add these globals. Just require (or import) this module in your app before anything else.

[globals]: ./globals.js

```js
require('node-libs-react-native/globals');
// ...
require('./app.js');
```

## Modules

The following are the module implementations provided by this package. Some modules also have a "mock" implementation provided in the `mock` directory. These are replacements with minimal functionality.

## Other React Native Modules

These are other React Native packages that implement Node core related
modules. They are not included in node-libs-react-native, but you may
find them useful separately.

### `dgram`

[react-native-udp][] implements Node's `dgram` API, but is not included
here due to its native implementation and need to use `react-native
link`.

[react-native-udp]: https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp

### `fs`

[react-native-fs][] implement's Node's `fs` API, but is not included
here due to its native implementation and need to use `react-native
link`.

[react-native-fs]: https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs

[react-native-level-fs][] provides an alternative pure JavaScript
implementation, using AsyncStorage as the underlying storage mechanism.

[react-native-level-fs]: https://github.com/tradle/react-native-level-fs

### `net`

[react-native-tcp][] implement's Node's `net` API, but is not included
here due to its native implementation and need to use `react-native
link`.

This is a fork of [node-libs-browser][] with minor modifications and packages swapped out for React Native implementations. Thanks to those package authors for doing the hard work.
